{"@type":"Question","name":"How much do yacht crew members make?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yacht crew salaries vary significantly by position, yacht size, and experience. Entry-level positions (junior deckhand, junior stewardess) on yachts 80-120 feet pay $2,500-$4,000 per month. Mid-level positions (experienced deckhand, chief stewardess, second engineer) pay $4,000-$7,000 per month. Senior positions (first mate, chief engineer, head chef) pay $6,000-$12,000 per month. Captains of superyachts (100+ feet) earn $8,000-$20,000+ per month. All positions include free accommodation, food, and often health insurance, meaning nearly all salary is disposable income. Tips from charter guests can add 10-20% to annual earnings."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"What certifications do you need to work on a yacht?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The minimum certification for yacht crew is the STCW (Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping) basic safety training certificate, which covers personal survival techniques, fire prevention, personal safety, and first aid. The STCW course takes 5-10 days and costs $1,000-$2,000. Additionally, you need an ENG1 medical certificate (or equivalent) confirming fitness for sea service. For specific positions, additional certifications are required: deckhands need a Powerboat Level 2 or RYA certificate, engineers need marine engineering qualifications, and captains need progressively higher licenses (Yachtmaster, Master of Yachts, or equivalent)."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"How do you find yacht crew jobs?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The primary methods are: crew agencies (Crew4Yachts, YachtCrewLink, Dockwalk), online job boards (CrewSeekers, Yachting Pages), walking the docks in yachting hubs (Fort Lauderdale, Antibes, Palma de Mallorca) with printed CVs, and networking within the yacht crew community. Fort Lauderdale is the primary hiring hub for Caribbean-based yachts (hiring season September-November), while Antibes and Palma serve the Mediterranean fleet (hiring season March-May). First-time crew members often have the most success walking the docks and making personal impressions."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you need experience to work on a yacht?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No prior yachting experience is required for entry-level positions, though it helps. Most entry-level yacht crew start as junior deckhands or junior stewardesses. Transferable skills from hospitality (hotels, restaurants, bartending), outdoor industries (diving, water sports, adventure tourism), or maritime backgrounds (sailing, fishing, coast guard) are valued. A positive attitude, willingness to work hard, and professional appearance often matter more than specific yachting experience for first-time crew. Complete your STCW and ENG1 certifications before job hunting."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"What is life like working on a yacht?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yacht crew life is a mix of hard work and extraordinary experiences. During charter seasons, expect 14-to-18-hour days, 7 days a week, with limited personal time. Accommodation is in small shared cabins below deck. Privacy is minimal. However, between charters, crew often get time to explore destinations most people can only dream of visiting. The saving potential is significant since living expenses are nearly zero. The crew community is tight-knit and international. Many crew describe it as the hardest they have ever worked and the best experience of their lives. Burnout is common after 3-5 years, and most crew eventually transition to shore-based careers in the marine industry."}}

    <h1>Yacht Crew Career Guide 2026: Jobs, Pay, Certifications and How to Start</h1>
    <p>Working on a superyacht is one of the few careers that pays you to travel the world while covering nearly all your living expenses. Yacht crew members visit destinations most people only see in magazines, earn competitive salaries with minimal expenses, and develop skills that translate to a wide range of shore-based careers in the marine, hospitality, and management industries. The global superyacht fleet has grown to over 5,500 vessels in 2026, creating sustained demand for qualified crew across all positions.</p>
    <p>But yacht crew life is not the perpetual vacation that social media portrays. The work is physically demanding, the hours are long, the living quarters are cramped, and the pressure to deliver flawless service to wealthy guests is intense. This guide provides an honest, comprehensive overview of what a yacht crew career actually involves in 2026: the positions available, realistic salary expectations, required certifications and their costs, how to find your first job, and what daily life aboard is genuinely like.</p>

    <h2 id="positions">Crew Positions Explained</h2>
    <h3>Deck Department</h3>
    <p>The deck department handles the exterior of the yacht: navigation, anchoring, docking, tender operations, water sports equipment, and exterior maintenance. The entry-level position is junior deckhand, responsible for washing, polishing, and maintaining the exterior surfaces, assisting with docking lines, and operating the tender (a small boat used to transport guests to shore). Experienced deckhands take on more responsibility for navigation watches, anchor watches, and water sports instruction. The bosun manages the deck team, and the first officer (first mate) is second-in-command to the captain, responsible for safety systems, navigation planning, and crew management.</p>
    <h3>Interior Department</h3>
    <p>The interior department manages everything inside the yacht: guest cabins, dining service, housekeeping, laundry, and bar service. Junior stewardesses handle cabin cleaning, laundry, and table setting. Experienced stewardesses manage wine service, cocktails, floral arrangements, and guest preferences. The chief stewardess runs the entire interior operation, managing the team, provisioning, budgeting, and directly interfacing with guests and the captain on all interior matters. Interior positions require hospitality skills, attention to detail, and the ability to anticipate guest needs before they are expressed.</p>
    <h3>Galley (Kitchen)</h3>
    <p>The yacht chef is responsible for all meals aboard: crew meals (typically for 8-20 crew members three times daily) and guest meals that can rival Michelin-starred restaurants. Yacht chefs must accommodate diverse dietary requirements, source ingredients in multiple countries, manage galley provisioning budgets of $1,000-$5,000+ per day on large yachts, and cook in a kitchen that moves. Top yacht chefs earn $7,000-$12,000 per month and are among the highest-paid crew positions. Previous restaurant experience is essential, and specialized yacht chef training courses are available.</p>
    <h3>Engineering Department</h3>
    <p>Engineers maintain all mechanical and electrical systems aboard: main engines, generators, watermakers, air conditioning, hydraulics, plumbing, and electrical systems. The engineering department requires formal qualifications (marine engineering certificates or equivalent) and is the most technically demanding department on board. Entry-level engineer positions require relevant technical qualifications and often previous experience in marine or industrial engineering. Chief engineers on large yachts earn $8,000-$15,000 per month.</p>
    <h3>Captain</h3>
    <p>The captain has ultimate responsibility for the vessel, crew, and guests. Captains manage all operations, navigation, safety, budgeting, and crew management. They interface directly with yacht owners and charter guests. Reaching captain level requires years of progressive maritime qualifications and sea time. Captains of 80-to-120-foot yachts earn $8,000-$15,000 per month. Captains of superyachts over 150 feet earn $15,000-$25,000+ per month, plus benefits and annual bonuses.</p>

    </tbody></table>
    <div class="callout"><div class="callout-title">Tips Add Up</div><p>Charter yacht guests typically tip 10-20% of the charter fee, split among the crew. On a $50,000 weekly charter, a 15% tip ($7,500) split among 6 crew members adds approximately $1,250 per crew member per charter week. During busy charter seasons, tips can add 20-40% to your base salary. Private (non-charter) yachts typically pay higher base salaries but do not receive tips.</p></div>

    <h2 id="certifications">Required Certifications</h2>
    <h3>STCW Basic Safety Training</h3>
    <p>The STCW (Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping) basic safety training certificate is the minimum requirement for all yacht crew positions worldwide. The course covers four modules: personal survival techniques (sea survival, life raft operation, hypothermia prevention), fire prevention and fire fighting (extinguisher use, breathing apparatus, fire drills), elementary first aid (CPR, wound care, emergency protocols), and personal safety and social responsibilities (shipboard safety, environmental protection, human relationships). The course takes 5-10 days and costs $1,000-$2,000 depending on location. Major training centers are located in Fort Lauderdale, Antibes, Palma de Mallorca, and Southampton.</p>
    <h3>ENG1 Medical Certificate</h3>
    <p>An ENG1 (or equivalent) seafarer medical certificate confirms that you are medically fit for service at sea. The examination covers vision, hearing, physical fitness, cardiovascular health, and any conditions that could be dangerous at sea. The certificate is valid for two years and costs $100-$200. In the US, the equivalent is the USCG Medical Certificate; in the UK, the MCA ENG1.</p>
    <h3>Additional Certifications</h3>
    <p>Beyond STCW and ENG1, additional certifications strengthen your application and may be required for specific positions. A Powerboat Level 2 or RYA Day Skipper certificate is expected for deckhands. Food hygiene certification (such as ServSafe) is required for interior crew who serve food. A PADI Divemaster certification is valuable if the yacht offers diving. Wine certification (WSET Level 2 or 3) is increasingly expected for chief stewardesses. The total cost to get fully certified for an entry-level position (STCW + ENG1 + Powerboat Level 2 + food hygiene) is approximately $2,000-$3,500.</p>

    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Your First Yacht Crew Job</h2>
    <p>The most successful approach for first-time crew combines three strategies: register with crew placement agencies, create profiles on yacht crew job boards, and walk the docks in a yachting hub with printed CVs.</p>
    <p>Dock walking remains the most effective method for first-time crew. Arrive in Fort Lauderdale (September-November for Caribbean season) or Antibes/Palma (March-May for Med season) with your certifications completed, 50+ printed CVs with a professional photo, appropriate dock-walking attire (polo shirt, shorts or chinos, boat shoes), and enough savings to support yourself for 4-8 weeks while job hunting. Visit marinas early morning (8-9am) when crew are preparing for the day. Introduce yourself to crew members on deck, explain your qualifications, and leave your CV. Be persistent, positive, and professional. Many first-time crew find positions within 2-4 weeks of active dock walking.</p>
    <p>Online, create profiles on CrewSeekers, Dockwalk, Crew4Yachts, and YachtCrewLink. These platforms connect crew with yacht management companies and captains hiring for upcoming seasons. A professional yacht crew CV differs from a standard resume: include a professional headshot, list all maritime certifications, emphasize relevant hospitality or outdoor experience, and keep it to one page.</p>

    <h2 id="daily-life">Daily Life Aboard</h2>
    <p>Daily life varies dramatically between charter mode and travel/maintenance mode. During charter, the focus is entirely on guest service. A typical charter day for interior crew begins at 6:00-6:30am with breakfast preparation, continues through lunch service, afternoon activities, sunset cocktails, and dinner service, and often does not end until 10:00-11:00pm or later. Deck crew start similarly early with tender operations and water sports setup and work until all guest activities are complete. Days off during charter are rare.</p>
    <p>Between charters or during delivery passages, the schedule is more relaxed. Crew handle maintenance, deep cleaning, provisioning, and personal time. Most yachts operate a rotation schedule with 1-2 days off per week during non-charter periods. Some yachts offer extended leave between seasons, while others expect year-round availability.</p>
    <p>Accommodation is in crew cabins below deck, typically shared with one other crew member. Cabins are small -- similar in size to a train sleeper compartment -- with a bunk bed, small closet, and shared bathroom. Privacy is limited, and the ability to live comfortably in close quarters with colleagues is one of the most important qualities for yacht crew. The crew mess (dining area) serves as the social hub, and meal quality depends on the yacht's budget and chef.</p>

    <h2 id="seasons">Yacht Seasons and Locations</h2>
    <p>The superyacht world follows two primary seasons. The Mediterranean season runs from May through October, with yachts based primarily in the south of France (Antibes, Monaco, Cannes), Spain (Palma de Mallorca, Ibiza), Italy (Sardinia, Naples), Greece, Turkey, and Croatia. The Caribbean season runs from November through April, with yachts based in Fort Lauderdale, the US Virgin Islands, St. Maarten, Antigua, and the Bahamas. Many yachts cross the Atlantic between seasons, a two-to-three-week passage that is one of the most memorable experiences in a yacht crew career.</p>

    <h2 id="career-path">Career Progression</h2>
    <p>Yacht crew careers follow established progression paths. A deckhand can advance to bosun, then first officer, and eventually captain over 8-15 years with progressive certifications and sea time. A stewardess can advance to second stewardess, chief stewardess, and eventually purser or yacht manager. At each step, additional certifications and documented sea time are required. The investment in certification is significant but pays off through salary increases at each level.</p>
    <p>Many crew eventually transition to shore-based careers in the yachting industry: yacht management companies, shipyards, maritime training centers, charter brokerages, or marine equipment suppliers. The skills developed aboard -- leadership, problem-solving under pressure, attention to detail, and cross-cultural communication -- are highly valued in these roles.</p>
